## Coding Resources I recommend

### Text Editor
1. [Atom](http://atom.io)
2. [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
3. [Cloud 9](http://c9.io) this is an online text editor with full linux terminal and other benefits.

All 3 softwares are completely free to use, but cloud 9 need you to give credit card information to authenticate. **It doesn't charge your card**

### Online Resources mostly needed.

1. [Materialised Css](http://materializecss.com/)
2. [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com) Excellent Basic Resource for learning some syntax for the code. **Don't look for html and css here as much as possible tho as materializecss should have what we need**
3. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

I wouldn't recommend going to stackoverflow or w3 schools directly but instead googling your question and look for links in these sites.**For anything to do with Html or Css go to materializecss first, before googling**


### Github Client
1. [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) This is the gui client which is very easy to understand and use, would highly recommend for beginners.
2. [Cloud 9](http://c9.io) If you are using Cloud 9 it come with a full linux terminal which has github built in, but you will need to learn git commands for that.
3. Linux/Mac Terminal , Github comes built into any macos or linux terminal but again you have to learn git commands for that. This is also available on windows by getting a separate git bash but wouldn't recommend that.

### Comment Standards
As most of you are beginners to programming it is very important to comment as it will allow you and others to understand easily what you mean instead of trying to understand the code themselves
1. Html
```Html
  <!-- Comment Like this in Html -->
```

2. Javascript
```Javascript
 // this is a comment in Javascript
```

### Basic Git commands
#### Git Pull
 git pull - this pull all changes made by you on other systems or by someone else to your workspace.
#### Git Push
1. git add "filename.txt" - this stages a specific page and is the first step of the push process. **You can use git add . to stage all changed files**
2. git commit -m "your commit message" - this adds a commit message to the code you are pushing. **Please use relevant commit message to signify push and not some random nonsense**
3. git push - this is the last step in the push process. Once this command is enter it will ask for your username, please enter your github username. after which it will ask for your password, **your password won't be shown on the console while typing it, so just type your password even tho it might seem like nothing is changing**
